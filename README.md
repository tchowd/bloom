# Bloom

## Vision

Bloom is a solution based platform built by builders for builders. It is meant to minimize time on researching and spend it more on creating. The platform is bridging communication between the builders and the core developers to help both parties to build further, faster. It also meant to incentivize contributors for helping their peers to solve the issues. 
- Biderectional communication between protocols and builders
- Validated responses
- No wait time to move on with implementation of new ideas
- Incentive mechanism creates engaged community of builders helping to build the ecosystem


## Problem
Currently to build on a new techology you need to read an immense amount of documentation or search for answers in multiple unreliable sources. Teams need to allocate resources and time trying to answer often repetitive questions or end up directing people to read the documentation. It also takes debeloper's time from building to updating the documentation. That slows down the process for builders and core teams 
For the developers there is a lack of clarity and reliability on sources of information. Sifting through forums or trying to connect with the team on their social channels to getting the answer is unclear, leaving them asking wen to build. And no incentive to contribute to the community

For the teams, answering the question, especially technical takes developers  time from working on a project and requires additional resources to monitor multiple channels.

For both parties time is spent ineeficiently instead of innovative.
## Solution
Bloom is a solution based platform for builders, where they can find the answers in one place, validated by the community and verified by the project's core team. No more scrolling through multiple forums or channels. 
Developers that contribute by answeering their peers get rewarded by the protocols. That way you are not only contributing to the ecosysytem development but also get recognition from projects for your contribution. 

## Experience:
As a dev contributor:
1. Once you will go through the onboarding flow. You would need to  authenicate your identity  by connecting a wallet. We used **WALLET CONNECT**, **WEB3AUTH** ,and **COINBASE WALLET**  for a seamless sig up process
2. Once they connect through the wallet. They can access their profiles built on **LENS PROTOCOL**
3. They can ask questions 




# Ecosystem Bounties & Sponsor Prizes:
#### Lens Protocol 
Lens Protocol is a composable and decentralized social graph. It lets creators take ownership of their content wherever they go in the digital garden of the decentralized internet. With Lens Protocol, you are in control. You own your profile, where you use it, how you use it, and even how you monetize it. We used Lens Protocol to create a smart contract profile for our users.

#### Lens on Polygon 
We built a social Dapp with **Lens Protocol**. Lens is a user-owned social graph # onPolygon. We have built a social dapp with Lens to create developer's profiles to keep track of their rewards and contributions

#### Polygon 
For our applications process we are deploying our smart contracts on Polygon as it is offers scaling and infrastructure support to Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) and is not plagued by the high transaction fees and network congestion that impacts the Ethereum network.

#### Optimism: 
We wanted to make our platform multichain, and at Bloom we are super optimistic about open source contributions and builders communities.

#### IPFS & Filecoin 
will be used to store the data for the applications in a decentralized and easy to use manner. Filecoin is completely open-source, enabling developers from all over the world to us our protocol. We loved how easy and simplified it was to store our data and push it to our platform or discord.

#### WalletConnect
the web3 communications protocol enabling wallets and apps to securely connect.  The recently-launched WalletConnect v2.0 takes our interoperability promise one step further with multi-chain support, allowing developers to build and achieve compatibility across blockchains and roll-ups. We use  **WalletConnect** to authenticate a user signing.

#### Web3Auth 
simple, non-custodial auth infrastructure that enables Web3 wallets and applications to provide seamless user logins to both mainstream and native Web3 users. We used the technology to provide a seamless signing experience to our users.

#### Ethereum Push Notification Service (PUSH) 
we are using the decentralized communication & notification protocol for Web3. Using the protocol, both sponsors and developers can send on-chain or off-chain notifications tied to wallet addresses in a multichain, open, platform agnostic way- this is perfect considering we are using Polygon, Optimism and Harmony. This will provide efficient, open communication for sponsors to hear about the deliverables being met and developers to get notified wen funding
